# SBA-320H

This is a React web application that interacts with PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) using Axios and the useEffect hook in order to build a Generation 6 pokedex. The user selects a region and is directed to a list of Pokémon that originated in that region. If the user decides to view all Pokémon from that point, a search bar component is rendered that will filter the list if typed. A Pokémon card is then rendered that contains information such as an image, name, genus, height, weight, types, description, and base stats. If the user clicks on the image, the Pokémon's cry will play as and audio tag using the useRef hook. Almost all of the elements are rendered as a separate JSX component except the base stats as that was a last minute addition.
